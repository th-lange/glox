# Golang implementation of lox

This is an golang implementation of the
[lox-language](http://www.craftinginterpreters.com/the-lox-language.html) interpreter 
to get aquainted with building interpreters. So it is inspired by:

[CraftingInterpreters](https://github.com/munificent/craftinginterpreters)



This is a rewrite of the java implementation of the book.

Thank you @munificent for publishing the instructions.
